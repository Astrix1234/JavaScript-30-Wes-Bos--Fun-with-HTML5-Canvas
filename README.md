## About

This is one of Wes Bosa's great JavaScript30 cursu lessons. His course was recommended to me by my wonderful GO IT mentor Malgorzata Kowacka, as an additional exercise for learning Java Script. And now I highly recommend it to all learners - with Wes Bos you can really love Java Script :smile:. Thank you so much Malgorzata Kowacka :heart:
